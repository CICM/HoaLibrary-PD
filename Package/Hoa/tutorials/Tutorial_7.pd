#X text 1 55 With Ambisonics \, decoding is the operation that synthesizes
the signals of the loudspeakers. As in any spatialisation technique
\, this operation has advantages and limitations., f 65;
#X text 1 105 Ambisonics allows to synthesize several sound fields
and to decodes them with only a one operation offering. This advantage
allows to reduce the CPU usage., f 65;
#X text 1 235 Ambisonics offers a homogeneous rendering of the sound
field. Unlike other techniques where the angular resolution varies
depending on the sources directions \, Ambisonics provides a constant
angular resolution across the circle., f 65;
#X text 1 475 With Ambisonics \, the auditor should be ideally placed
at the center of the loudspeakers array otherwise the sound field resitution
will be distorted. However \, the use of the maxRe or inPhase optimizations
(see hoa.optim~ object) can make up this artefact (to the detriment
of the spatial resolution) and offers the possibility of an audience
spread all over the circle., f 65;
#X text 1 155 The separation of these two operations allows to perform
many operations between them \, in the circular harmonics domain \,
and also to record the sound field in this domain. Thus \, it is possible
to adapt the sound field to the speakers arrengement., f 65;
#X text 1 305 Nevertheless \, the restitution system is restricted
by the order of decomposition. The number of loudspeakers must be higher
than or equal to the number of harmonics. Thus \, the minimum number
of loudspeakers is 3 for an order of decomposition of 1 Futhermore
\, the loudspeakers must be placed on a circle or a sphere at equal
distance from each other. However \, these restrictions can be bypassed
to the detriment of the quality of the sound field restitution. Thus
\, in practise \, it is \, in fact \, possible to project the sound
field on many loudspeakers systems from stereo to an infinity of loudspeakers
through all irregular configurations such as 5.1 \, 7.1 and headphones
(see hoa.decoder~ object)., f 65;
